<h2>What is this website for?</h2>
<p>
  If you are not familiar with the Perl programming language this website probably is of no help for you. If you are a programmer and Perl does not scare you (btw: why should it?) this website might be of interest. You can download any module documentation available on <a href="http://metacpan.org">MetaCPAN</a>, reformatted for the most popular ebook readers. You can also get the tutorials from <a href="http://perltuts.com">perltuts.com</a> for your reader.
</p>

<h2>How did you do that?</h2>
<p>
  The following modules were crucial for this project:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Mojolicious">Mojolicious</a> - Real-time web framework.<br />
    Used for every interaction with the user.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/MetaCPAN::API">MetaCPAN::API</a> - A comprehensive, DWIM-featured API to MetaCPAN.<br />
    Does all the communication with MetaCPAN.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/EPublisher">EPublisher</a> - Publish documents in new format<br />
    Used to transform POD into EBooks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/EBook::MOBI">EBook::MOBI</a> - Create an eBook in the MOBI format - out of POD formatted content.<br />
    Library to create EBooks in the MOBI format, which is sadly not open but wide spread among users.
  </li>
  <li>... and many more from the <a href="https://metacpan.org/">CPAN</a>.</li>
</ul>
