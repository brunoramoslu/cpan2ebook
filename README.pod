=head1 What is this?

This is the source code of L<perlybook.org|http://perlybook.org/>.
The whole idea is to offer perl documentation in other formats.
This allows others to read perl documentation on devices which are not capable of interpreting POD.
Feel free to contact us, if you feel there should be another format added, especially if you are willing to contribute the code that provides it.
